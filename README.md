#### Setup

I'll be using `yarn` commands but you can also use `npm` the same way as usual

```
$ npm install
``` 
This will install all of the requried packages for the project!

```
$ yarn server
```
This command will start the json server where the "database" will be held for the tasks

```
$ yarn start
```
This command will start up the Development build for the website

```
$ yarn build
```
This will create a `build` folder containing everything you need for the production.


You can find the website on your own machine at http://localhost:3000
You can also find the `json-server` at http://localhost:5000/tasks
